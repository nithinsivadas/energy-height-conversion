%
%  Apply aberration to transform natural direction into proper
%  direction.
%
%  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
%  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
%
%  Status:  support function.
%
%  Given:
%    pnat(3)       natural direction to the source (unit vector)
%    v(3)          observer barycentric velocity in units of c
%    s             distance between the Sun and the observer (au)
%    bm1           sqrt(1-|v|^2): reciprocal of Lorenz factor
%
%  Returned:
%    ppr(3)        proper direction to source (unit vector)
%
%  Notes:
%  1) The algorithm is based on Expr. (7.40) in the Explanatory
%     Supplement (Urban & Seidelmann 2013), but with the following
%     changes:
%
%     o  Rigorous rather than approximate normalization is applied.
%
%     o  The gravitational potential term from Expr. (7) in
%        Klioner (2003) is added, taking into account only the Sun's
%        contribution.  This has a maximum effect of about
%        0.4 microarcsecond.
%
%  2) In almost all cases, the maximum accuracy will be limited by the
%     supplied velocity.  For example, if the SOFA iauEpv00 function is
%     used, errors of up to 5 microarcseconds could occur.
