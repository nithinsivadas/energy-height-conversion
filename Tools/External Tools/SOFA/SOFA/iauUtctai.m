%  Time scale transformation:  Coordinated Universal Time, UTC, to
%  International Atomic Time, TAI.
%
%  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
%  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
%
%  Status:  canonical.
%
%  Given:
%     utc1,utc2     UTC as a 2-part quasi Julian Date (Notes 1-4)
%
%  Returned:
%     tai1,tai2     TAI as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 5)
%
%  Notes:
%  1) utc1+utc2 is quasi Julian Date (see Note 2), apportioned in any
%     convenient way between the two arguments, for example where utc1
%     is the Julian Day Number and utc2 is the fraction of a day.
%
%  2) JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap second unless
%     special measures are taken.  The convention in the present
%     function is that the JD day represents UTC days whether the
%     length is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.
%
%  3) The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
%     introduction of the time scale and that are too far in the future
%     to be trusted.  See iauDat  for further details.
%
%  4) The function iauDtf2d converts from calendar date and time of day
%     into 2-part Julian Date, and in the case of UTC implements the
%     leap-second-ambiguity convention described above.
%
%  5) The returned TAI1,TAI2 are such that their sum is the TAI Julian
%     Date.
%
%  Called:
%     iauJd2cal    JD to Gregorian calendar
%     iauDat       delta(AT) = TAI-UTC
%     iauCal2jd    Gregorian calendar to JD
