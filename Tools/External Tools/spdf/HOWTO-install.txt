Download and Installation Instructions

Windows:

   Download one of following self-extracting files: 
       32-bit Windows: matlab_cdf364_win32.exe
       64-bit Windows: matlab_cdf364_win64.exe
   Download leap second table: CDFLeapSeconds.txt
   Set environment variable CDF_LEAPSECONDSTABLE to the downloaded leap second
       table. The step is necessary when a new leap second is added and the
       shared library is not upgraded. This environment variable needs to be
       set when running CDF modules under MATLAB. 
       set CDF_LEAPSECONDSTABLE=<...>\CDFLeapSeconds.txt (C/TCsh)
              where <...> is the directory that holds CDFLeapSeconds.txt
   Double-click the downloaded file to extract the files included 
       in the package to a directory (dafault to
       c:\matlab_cdf364_patch-[32|64]).
   Invoke Matlab and issue the following command at the Matlab prompt:
        addpath '<patch_install_dir>'
        For example, if the patch is installed under
        C:\matlab_cdf364_patch-[32|64], the command should be
          addpath 'C:\matlab_cdf364_patch-[32|64]'
   Use Matlab as usual (e.g. data=spdfcdfread('test.cdf')).

Mac OS X:

   Download one of the the following compressed tarfiles:
       Mac OS X Intel 32-bit: matlab_cdf364_mac32.tar.gz
       Mac OS X Intel 64-bit: matlab_cdf364_mac64.tar.gz
   Download leap second table: CDFLeapSeconds.txt 
   Move the Matlab-CDF-Patch directory in the downloaded file to the 
       directory you want the patch to be installed under.
   Extract the files in the package using the following command:
        tar zxvf <downloaded compressed tar file>
     [The extracted files will be placed in matlab_cdf364_patch-* directory,
      where * is either 32 or 64. depending the tarfile.]
   Set environment variable CDF_LEAPSECONDSTABLE to the downloaded leap second
       table. The step is necessary when a new leap second is added and the
       shared library is not upgraded. This environment variable needs to be
       set when running CDF modules under MATLAB. 
       setenv CDF_LEAPSECONDSTABLE <...>/CDFLeapSeconds.txt (C/TCsh)
       export CDF_LEAPSECONDSTABLE=<...>/CDFLeapSeconds.txt (Bourne/Bash)
              where <...> is the directory that holds CDFLeapSeconds.txt
   Invoke Matlab and issue the following command at the Matlab prompt:
        addpath '<patch_install_dir>' 
        For example, if the patch is installed under /Users/cdf, the 
        command should be
          addpath '/Users/cdf/matlab_cdf364_patch-[32|64]'
   Use Matlab as usual (e.g. data=spdfcdfread('test.cdf')).

Linux

   Download one of the following compressed tar files:
       Linux 32-bit: matlab_cdf364_lin32.tar.gz
       Linux 32-bit: matlab_cdf364_lin64.tar.gz
       Solaris/Sparc 64-bit: matlab_cdf364_sol64.tar.gz
   Download leap second table: CDFLeapSeconds.txt
   Go to the directory where you want the patch to be installed under.
   Extract the files in the package using the following command:
        tar zxvf <downloaded compressed tar file> 
     [The extracted files will be placed in matlab_cdf364_patch-x directory,
      where * is either 32 or 64. depending the tarfile.]
   Set environment variable CDF_LEAPSECONDSTABLE to the downloaded leap second
       table. The step is necessary when a new leap second is added and the
       shared library is not upgraded. This environment variable needs to be
       set when running CDF modules under MATLAB..
       setenv CDF_LEAPSECONDSTABLE <...>/CDFLeapSeconds.txt (C/TCsh)
       export CDF_LEAPSECONDSTABLE=<...>/CDFLeapSeconds.txt (Bourne/Bash)
              where <...> is the directory that holds CDFLeapSeconds.txt
   Invoke Matlab and issue the following command at the Matlab prompt:
        addpath '<patch_install_dir>'
        For example, if the patch is installed under /home/cdf, the
        command should be
          addpath '/home/cdf/matlab_cdf364_patch-[32|64]'
   Use Matlab as usual (e.g. data=spdfcdfread('test.cdf')).

Solaris:

   Download the following compressed tar file:
       Solaris/Sparc 64-bit: matlab_cdf364_sol64.tar.gz
   Download leap second table: CDFLeapSeconds.txt
   Go to the directory where you want the patch to be installed under.
   Extract the files in the package using the following command:
        tar zxvf <downloaded compressed tar file>
     [The extracted files will be placed in matlab_cdf364_patch-64 directory.]
   Set environment variable CDF_LEAPSECONDSTABLE to the downloaded leap second
       table. The step is necessary when a new leap second is added and the
       shared library is not upgraded. This environment variable needs to be
       set when running CDF modules under MATLAB..
       setenv CDF_LEAPSECONDSTABLE <...>/CDFLeapSeconds.txt (C/TCsh)
       export CDF_LEAPSECONDSTABLE=<...>/CDFLeapSeconds.txt (Bourne/Bash)
              where <...> is the directory that holds CDFLeapSeconds.txt
   Invoke Matlab and issue the following command at the Matlab prompt:
        addpath '<patch_install_dir>'
        For example, if the patch is installed under /export/home/cdf, the
        command should be
          addpath '/export/home/cdf/matlab_cdf364_patch-64'
   Use Matlab as usual (e.g. data=spdfcdfread('test.cdf')).
