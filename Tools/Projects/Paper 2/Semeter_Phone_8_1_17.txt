D-region conductivity 

D-region echoes to track Gravity waves (tracer for neutral motion) 

ISR reflection at really low altitudes (collision domintaed region, long-correlation times)

Stephen Kaepler 2016; Conductivity and average energy

1970s Jeff Theyer: Separates out various energy transfer mechanisms, it is possibility to derive neutral wind vector - & electric field where it is collision- and less - and determine what the neutral wind contribution might be.

Joule heating, fly wheel effect (revisit that work)

Average the electric field and square, and square electric field and average it => they have different results 
AMISR gives variations of conductivity

Classification of magnetosphere acceleration mechanism

Abstract 1. physics of magnetopsheric variablity and its relation with conductances
Abstract 2. how energy is dissipated into electromangnetic
