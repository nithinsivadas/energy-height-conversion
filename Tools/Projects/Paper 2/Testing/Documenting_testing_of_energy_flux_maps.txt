The optical auroral image superimposed on the 3 keV precipitation, does not match. This matched with the results created a year back. Possible reasons include:
  1. Std. deviation estimate of production rate (q) used
  2. Weighting function in MEM solving
  3. Coordinate transformation?

Trial 1: x
  1. q calculated from get_error_in_q() (changed from previous)
  2. W - flat distribution - (changed from previous)
  3. interpolate_to_field_aligned_coordinates() - (changed from previous)

  dNe has a lot of NANs, those are replaced by average of nonNAN dNe-s across time.

  For results see:
  Figures_v1_20080326
  20080326.001_bc_2min-energyFlux_v1.h5

  Notes: MSE is about 0.2 (which means we are over-fitting)

Trail 2: xx
    1. q calculate by simply taking variance across altitude. (same as previous)
    2. W - flat distribution - (changed from previous)
    3. interpolate_to_field_aligned_coordinates() - (changed from previous)

    For results see:
    Figures_v2_20080326
    20080326.001_bc_2min-energyFlux_v2.h5

    Notes: MSE is about 0.02 (which means we are further over-fitting)
    The 11:42:45 UT PFISR Energy flux map for 3 keV looks worse than trial 1.

Trial 3: x
    -> 1. q calculated from get_error_in_q() (changed from previous)
    2. W - flat distribution - (changed from previous)
    3. interpolate_to_field_aligned_coordinates() - (changed from previous)
    x 4. Remove the negative values in electron density...
    (In the previous trials we hadn't removed them...)
    For results see:
    Figures_v3_20080326
    20080326.001_bc_2min-energyFlux_v3.h5

    Notes: No change

Trial 4: xx
    -> 1. q calculated from get_error_in_q() (changed from previous)
    x  2. W - gaussmf[50,100] - (changed from previous)
    3. interpolate_to_field_aligned_coordinates() - (changed from previous)
    -> 4. Keep the negative values in electron density...
    (In the previous trials we hadn't removed them...)
    For results see:
    Figures_v4_20080326
    20080326.001_bc_2min-energyFlux_v4.h5
    Notes: Pretty bad

Trial 5: x
  -> 1. q calculated from get_error_in_q() (changed from previous)
  -> 2. W - flat distribution - (changed from previous)
  3. interpolate_to_field_aligned_coordinates() - (changed from previous)
  -> 4. Keep the negative values in electron density...
  x 5. altitude range adjusted from 60-200 to 60-180.

Trial 6: +
  -> 1. q calculated from get_error_in_q() (changed from previous)
  -> 2. W - flat distribution - (changed from previous)
  -> 3. create_energy_spectra_images - plot the pfisr map at peak ionization altitude;
        generate_energy_spectra_data_product: projection altitude of DASC @ 110 km
  -> 4. Keep the negative values in electron density...
  -> 5. altitude range from 60-200

    Notes: Slightly better correlation now.
    (Give warning to isnan in get_error_in_q() or remove it
    Check if there are complex numbers in the inverted flux results)

Trial 7:
    Addition to the above,
    2. W - distribution before [50,100]'
    6. change guess flux
.....
