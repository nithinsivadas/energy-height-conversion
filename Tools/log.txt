Here D-region is considered to be from 70-97 km (> 30 keV electrons)
Conductance contribution of D-region is about ~30% in EEA and ~50% in onset for Hall conductances
                                          and ~ 5% in EEA and ~10% in onset for Pedersen conductances
The total conductance of the EEA (D+E-region) is about 1/2 that of the conductance during Onset.
